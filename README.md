# NepalFlagManim
Learned and used Manim (Mathematical Animations) with Python to understand how Mathematical animations can be coded.

# Project Title
Nepalese Flag & Angle-Edge Bisectors.

## Introduction
Used Manim with Python to show the Nepalese flag's construction, using angle-edge bisectors.
The code is fairly poorly written, as this was the first-time I had ever even written in this library.
There are lots of issues, and this is really just here for documentation purposes.
I don't expect this to be productive for anyone around.
